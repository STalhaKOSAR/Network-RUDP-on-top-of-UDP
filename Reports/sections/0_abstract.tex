In the part 1 of this experiment we have already implemented TCP based connection between source and broker and UDP based connection for the rest. In this part, we created our own protocol on top of UDP to make UDP part reliable, that works on any topology or configuration network's. Our task is making UDP reliable for data transfer, although TCP is also provides us reliability. That's because RUDP is preferrable over TCP because TCP is not working properly (optimal) for network latency (the term used to specify any kind of delay that happens in data communication over a network). Sometimes, some properties of TCP is not desirable for building specific networks(e.g. game developers avoid TCP and make UDP reliable in the application level). In other words, in TCP, when any packet loss occurs, all subsequent of it are not allowed to occur in application-level until the lost one is re-transmitted(which causes another delay), even if they are still at other side of communication. To achieve this problems in some specific networks, RUDP is an option and in our experiment we have designed and implemented our RDT protocol on top of UDP.
