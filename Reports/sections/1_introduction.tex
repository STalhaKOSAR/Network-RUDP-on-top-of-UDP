In this experiment, we have already had a basic topology. As stated in part $1$ of this experiment, there are $2$ different connection protocols(TCP \& UDP). In the first part, we have done this topology by writing scripts for each of the nodes[See part $1$ report]. In this part, the problem is unreliable network and our main goal is making this network reliable. Which we need to make only UDP part reliable, since TCP based connections are already reliable. The requested implementations are pipe-lining \& multihoming, which are methods for solve this problem, and remove the dependencies on routers' scripts. Briefly, we are asked to make unreliable part (UDP based connections) reliable, and implement specifications of our own protocol.
